# C++-based Bottle Recycle Service
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
C++ console application that implements your bottle recycling system. It features:
	•	A main menu with options: “Aloita palautus” (Start recycling) and “Lopeta” (Exit).
	•	A recycling menu where users can select different bottle types, accumulating their value.
	•	A receipt generation system that summarizes the total amount earned and number of items recycled.
	•	A looping structure that keeps the program running until the user explicitly exits.
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
How It Works
	1.	When the application starts, it displays a main menu. The user can choose:
	•	1 to start recycling.
	•	0 to exit the application.
	2.	If the user chooses 1 (Aloita palautus):
	•	A new menu appears with different bottle and can options.
	•	Each option adds a specific deposit refund amount to the total.
	•	The loop continues until the user selects option 6 (Lopeta ja tulosta kuitti).
	3.	When option 6 is selected, the program:
	•	Generates a receipt with a breakdown of bottles/cans and the total refund amount.
	•	Returns to the main menu, allowing another session.
	4.	If the user selects 0 in the main menu, the application exits with a farewell message.
